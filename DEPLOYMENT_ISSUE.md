# üö® DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS

## **‚ùå Problem: API Root Still Returns Old JSON**
```bash
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/
# Still getting: {"message":"IoT Sensor Data API","version":"1.0"...}
```

## **‚úÖ WORKING ALTERNATIVES RIGHT NOW:**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Individual Endpoints (Should Work):**
```bash
# These may already be working:
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/spo2/     # Single SpO2 value
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/ecg/      # Single ECG value
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/max30102/ # Single MAX30102 value
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Health Check (Confirmed Working):**
```bash
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/health/   # Simple health status
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Use Bulk Upload (Definitely Working):**
```bash
# Send data and get live values back:
curl -X POST https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/sensors/bulk/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_id":"TEST","spo2":99.1,"ecg_heart_rate":73}'
  
# Should return:
# 73
# 99.1
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Test New Live Endpoint:**
```bash
# This should work once deployed:
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/live/
```

## **üîç DIAGNOSIS:**

### **Possible Causes:**
1. **Render Caching** - Old API response is cached
2. **Deployment Delay** - Changes not deployed yet  
3. **CDN Cache** - Edge cache serving old content
4. **Build Issues** - Deployment failed silently

### **Solutions to Try:**

#### **A) Force Cache Clear:**
```bash
# Add cache-busting parameter:
curl "https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/?t=$(date +%s)"

# Or try different headers:
curl -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" "https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/"
```

#### **B) Check Render Dashboard:**
- Go to render.com dashboard
- Check deployment logs
- Look for build errors
- Verify deployment completed

#### **C) Alternative URLs:**
```bash
# Try these while waiting:
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/live/      # New endpoint
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/api/health/    # Health check
curl https://iot-khgd.onrender.com/health/        # Root health
```

## **‚è≥ EXPECTED TIMELINE:**

- **5-10 minutes**: New endpoints should work
- **10-15 minutes**: Cache should clear
- **15-20 minutes**: API root should update

---

## **üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:**

1. **Test individual endpoints** - they might work already
2. **Use bulk upload** - definitely working for real data
3. **Wait 10 more minutes** - then test again
4. **If still broken** - check Render dashboard for errors

**The core functionality (individual sensor endpoints) should work even if the API root is cached!**
